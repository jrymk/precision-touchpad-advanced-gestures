# precision-touchpad-advanced-gestures
A simple-to-use Windows Precision Touchpad API and also an advanced gesture configurator for features such as 5 finger gestures

First off, all the Windows HID API handling code is from [ichisadashioko/windows-touchpad](https://github.com/ichisadashioko/windows-touchpad), as this is way beyond my skill level.

Although I did simplify it quite a bit, also support some touchpads (my touchpad) that reports each touch point as a separate... inputs? Check this [issue](https://github.com/emoacht/RawInput.Touchpad/issues/1) raised by the awesome [kamektx/TouchpadGestures_Advanced](https://github.com/kamektx/TouchpadGestures_Advanced) dev.
